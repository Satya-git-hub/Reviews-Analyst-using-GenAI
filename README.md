## Objective 
### Focus - Output Parser
You are building an AI system to be able to look at customer reviews and do some complex analysis. For each review get ChatGPT to do the following:
- Summarize the review: The summary should be at most 3 lines 
- Highlight both the positives and negatives
- Display the overall sentiment of the review (positive, negative, neutral)
- Display a list of 3-5 emotions expressed by the customer in the review
- If the snetiment is possitive or neutral write an email and thank you for the review
- If the sentiment is negative apologize and write an email with an appropriate response

Try to get the response in a nice structured format using an output *parser*
