The comprehensive set of rules, although at times seemingly stringent, contributed significantly to the overall well-being and cohesiveness of the community. The adherence to such guidelines by the residents and the proactive role played by the management created an atmosphere conducive to a comfortable and secure living experience.\n",

        "One of the standout features of Ajmera Infinity is the array of facilities available to residents. The meticulously maintained grounds provide a serene escape within the complex, complemented by well-kept swimming pools that offer a refreshing respite.

Additionally, the convenience of an on-site market within the premises adds a layer of accessibility and community integration, making daily life more convenient.\n",

I also shouted at him in retaliation asking where the exit sign board was. My question to the management is that when you all have not mentioned anything anywhere, then why don't you all ask your guards to guide us instead of shouting ? Or do you all think that visitors are omniscient beings to know everything ? How are we supposed to know ? This is the fault of the management and not the security guard.
